abstract: |
  Here we introduce a new form of photo-triggered antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy, called "shortmers," which allows for spatiotemporal control of gene expression with high resolution by photolitography. Shortmers require dual-recognition of their target by two very short probes (6-8 nucleotides) through a photo-inducible click chemistry. This technology addresses three significant challenges associated with traditional ASO therapy: reduced off-target effects due to dual-pair recognition, improved membrane diffusion due to their compact size aiding drug delivery, and localized impact via infrared spatial induction, thereby preventing systemic adverse side effects. As a proof-of-concept, we target the PTBP1 RNA-binding protein and demonstrate effective gene expression reduction, highlighting shortmers as a promising tool for targeted, efficient ASO-based therapies.

  \caption{ \textbf{Photo-patterned regulation of gene expression by ligation through photo-labile moieties. a)} Schematic demonstrating the difference between traditional gapmers for Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy compared to shortmers. \textbf{b)} Steps involved in shortmer activation. First shortmer ASOs are transfected into the cell and upon irradiation the short probes will anneal and autoligate onto the mRNA of interest. Lastly, inside the nucleus RNase H1 enzyme will bind to RNA:DNA hybrids and specifically digest the RNA part of the hybrid. \textbf{c)} Synthesis route for photo-ODIBO functional moeity. \textbf{d)} Decarbonylation of photo-ODIBO and subsequent SPAAC coupling to sodium azide. \textbf{e)} Chromatogram of products outlined in d). Dashed vertical lines shows chromatogram peaks for the different products. \textbf{f)} Non-specific labeling of all proteins in HEK293 cells using NHS-azide ester, followed by coupling to the DBCO-AZdye594 fluorophore (magenta) through strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). DNA is visualized using DAPI (blue). \textbf{g)} Photo-irradiation setup: A square-shaped SMD LED is projected onto a monolayer of HEK293 cells.\textbf{h)} Visualization of the photo-SPAAC reaction: Azides are first attached to all proteins using NHS-azide. Next, DBCO-PEG4-photo-ODIBO is coupled to the azides through conventional SPAAC. The tissue is then irradiated, causing uncaging of ODIBO moieties, which are subsequently reacted with azide-AZdye594 for visualization. Scale bars 20 $\mu$m. \textbf{i)} Comparison of \emph{in situ} labeling efficiency of direct traditional SPAAC versus photo-SPAAC ($n = 4$). }
