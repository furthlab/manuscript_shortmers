abstract: |
  Here we introduce a new form of photo-triggered antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy, called "shortmers," which allows for spatiotemporal control of gene expression with high resolution by photolitography. Shortmers require dual-recognition of their target by two very short probes (6-8 nucleotides) through a photo-inducible click chemistry. This technology addresses three significant challenges associated with traditional ASO therapy: reduced off-target effects due to dual-pair recognition, improved membrane diffusion due to their compact size aiding drug delivery, and localized impact via infrared spatial induction, thereby preventing systemic adverse side effects. As a proof-of-concept, we target the PTBP1 RNA-binding protein and demonstrate effective gene expression reduction, highlighting shortmers as a promising tool for targeted, efficient ASO-based therapies.
